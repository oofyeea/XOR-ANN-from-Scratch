I created an artificial neural network that solves the XOR problem from scratch, with no external libraries except for standard libraries. This was (obviously) quite math heavy, but fun to implement as a challenge. This uses an architecture with 2 input neurons (2x1), 1 hidden layer with 2 neurons and ReLU output, and output layer with softmax output (wanted to try softmax instead of obvious sigmoid for binary classification). I might add functions to save/load network parameters in the future. Thanks!
